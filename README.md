I HATE SafeConnect

SafeConnect sucks. It doesn't do much, other than leak memory, get stuck in loops that use 100% of the CPU, or crash (if you're lucky...)

ihsc bypasses the SafeConnect login by periodically sending out http requests to various websites, with various user-agent strings for non-PC devices.
Since SafeConnect is not generally required for these devices, it doesn't force you to log in or use their shitty software.
